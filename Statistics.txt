Here's the updated list with those additions and some other potential statistics based on the data:

Updated Statistics List:

1. General Match Statistics:

Total Matches Played
Matches by Tournament
2. Player Statistics:

Matches Played
Wins
Losses
Draws (Ties)
Win Percentage
Non-Loss Percentage (Win + Draw Percentage)
Average Finish Type
Win Streak/Loss Streak
Points Standings: Total points accumulated by each player (this will require defining a point system).
3. Combination Statistics:

Matches Played
Wins
Losses
Draws
Win Percentage
Non-Loss Percentage
Average Finish Type
Most Common Opponent Combination
Best Matchups (Combinations)
Worst Matchups (Combinations)
Points Standings: Total points accumulated by each combination.
4. Beyblade Part Statistics (Blade, Ratchet, Bit):

Usage Frequency
Win Percentage (with caveats mentioned previously)
Most Common Combinations
Points Standings: Total points accumulated by combinations using each part.
5. Stadium Statistics:

Matches Played in Stadium
Win Percentage by Stadium
Combination Performance by Stadium
Player Performance by Stadium
6. Launcher Statistics:

Usage Frequency
Win Percentage (for each Launcher/Launcher Class)
Combination Performance by Launcher Class
Player Performance by Launcher Class
7. Matchups (Player vs. Player, Combination vs. Combination):

Head-to-Head Records
Win Percentage in Head-to-Head Matchups
Additional Statistics Worth Considering (Based on the Data):

Finish Type Distribution: The percentage of each finish type (Burst, Ring Out, Over, Spin) across all matches, for each player, for each combination, and perhaps even for each stadium. This can reveal interesting trends.
Average Match Length (If Time Data is Available): If you start recording match duration, you could calculate the average match length overall, for different combinations, or in different stadiums. This is not currently available in the sample data.
Most Common Matchups: The most frequently occurring matchups between players or combinations. This can highlight popular pairings or common strategies.
Tournament Standings: If you want to track standings within specific tournaments, you can calculate points and rankings based on match results within each tournament.
Elo Rating (Advanced): If you want a more sophisticated ranking system that takes into account the relative skill of the opponents, you could implement an Elo rating system. This is a more complex undertaking but can provide more accurate rankings.
Points System:

For points standings, you'll need to define a point system. Here's a common example:

Win: 3 points
Draw: 1 point
Loss: 0 points
You can adjust these values based on your preferences.

With these additions and considerations, we have a very comprehensive list of statistics to work with. I believe this covers all the important aspects and provides a good foundation for a robust statistics system.
