Here is the existing app.py, index.html, and the html templates that relate to the aspects of the application that I need some help with.

Goals:

Refactor Statistics Calculation: Revamp the statistics calculation logic in /combinations/stats to enhance maintainability and facilitate future additions without extensive code modifications.
Correct Calculation Errors: Address inaccuracies in the existing statistics, ensuring correct calculations for metrics like "Most Common Combination."
Enhanced Combination Statistics: Expand the /combinations/stats page to display:
Specific combinations with the highest win/non-loss percentages against the selected combination.
Stadium classes where the selected combination performs best/worst.
Player performance (success rates) with the selected combination.
Maintain Leaderboard Functionality: Preserve the current behavior of the /leaderboard function.
Detailed Statistics: Implement detailed statistics displays for various entities (Players, Combinations, Beyblade Types, Blades, Ratchets, Bits) encompassing metrics like:
Win percentage
Non-loss percentage
Best matchups (opponents with the highest win rate)
Worst matchups (opponents with the lowest win rate)
Most likely finish types
MQTT Integration: Fix the existing MQTT publishing functionality to enable statistics/standings presentation in Home Assistant. This involves:
Publishing statistics to a designated topic.
Publishing Home Assistant MQTT Discovery messages for seamless data integration.
Existing Code Analysis (Based on the Provided Gist):

Frontend (index.html and HTML templates):
Likely utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure the user interface and interact with the backend API.
Specific details about template structures and data binding mechanisms are required for a more comprehensive analysis.
Backend (app.py):
Flask framework is employed for web application development.
Routes are defined for handling various API requests (/tournaments/stats, /combinations/stats, /leaderboard, etc.).
The statistics calculation logic seems to be embedded within these routes, potentially leading to code duplication and maintenance challenges.
Potential Improvements:

Modular Statistics Calculation:

Create a separate module (e.g., statistics.py) to encapsulate all statistics calculation logic.
This module would take raw data (matches, players, etc.) as input and return calculated statistics.
Specific functions could be defined for calculating win percentages, common combinations, matchup performance, etc.
This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and easier integration of new statistics in the future.
Data Access Layer:

Consider introducing a data access layer (e.g., using SQLAlchemy or a similar ORM) to manage database interactions.
This layer would abstract database operations, making the code less dependent on specific database details.
Clearer Data Structures:

Ensure that data structures (dictionaries, lists) used to store and manipulate statistics are well-defined and easy to understand.
Descriptive variable names and comments can enhance code readability.
Frontend Enhancements:

The frontend templates might need adjustments to accommodate the new modular statistics calculation and potentially display additional statistics.
Explore using JavaScript libraries or frameworks for dynamic data visualization (e.g., charts, graphs).
MQTT Library Integration:

Utilize a Python MQTT library (e.g., Paho-MQTT) to establish communication with the MQTT broker.
Implement functions to publish statistics data to the designated topic and generate Home Assistant MQTT Discovery messages.
Next Steps:

Detailed Code Review: In the next session, we can delve deeper into the provided code (app.py, HTML templates) to gain a more thorough understanding of the data structures, algorithms, and frontend-backend interactions.
Refactoring Plan: Based on the code review, we can formulate a concrete refactoring plan, outlining the steps to modularize statistics calculation, potentially introduce a data access layer, and improve code clarity.
Frontend Integration: We can then discuss how to integrate the refactored backend with the frontend templates to display the enhanced statistics and potentially leverage JavaScript libraries for data visualization.
MQTT Implementation: Finally, we can address the MQTT integration, exploring the use of a Python MQTT library to publish data and discovery messages for Home Assistant.
By following this plan, we can systematically improve your Beyblade statistics application, making it more maintainable, adaptable to future additions, and enabling seamless integration with Home Assistant for data visualization.

Update:
Here's how this information influences our approach:

Database (MariaDB): Since you're using MariaDB, we have several good options for a data access layer (ORM) in Python:

SQLAlchemy: This is a powerful and flexible ORM that supports a wide range of databases, including MariaDB. It provides excellent control over database interactions and is a good choice for complex applications. I would recommend this as the primary ORM to use.
Peewee: A lightweight and easy-to-use ORM that also supports MariaDB. It might be suitable if your database interactions are relatively simple, but SQLAlchemy gives a better base for expansion in the future.
Reverse Proxy (Nginx): The presence of Nginx as a reverse proxy is good practice and likely won't require any changes during this refactoring. It handles routing and load balancing, which are separate concerns from the application logic we'll be working on.

MQTT Broker (EMQX): Knowing you have a functional EMQX cluster simplifies the MQTT integration significantly. We can focus on using a suitable Python MQTT client library (like Paho-MQTT) to publish data to your existing broker. The fact that it is already integrated with Home Assistant is a significant advantage, as we can focus on ensuring the data being published is in a format that Home Assistant can understand.

Frontend Libraries/Frameworks (Open): Since you're open to using frontend libraries/frameworks, we can consider several options to enhance the user interface and data visualization:

For Data Visualization:
Chart.js: A popular and easy-to-use library for creating various types of charts (line, bar, pie, etc.). It's a good choice for displaying statistical data.
D3.js: A more powerful and flexible library for creating complex and custom data visualizations. It has a steeper learning curve but offers greater control. Probably overkill for this project.
For UI Enhancements (Optional, but Recommended):
Vue.js or React: These are popular JavaScript frameworks for building interactive user interfaces. They provide component-based architecture, data binding, and other features that can significantly improve the development process and user experience. If you are comfortable with JavaScript, I would strongly recommend using either Vue or React for the frontend.
Revised Next Steps:

Detailed Code Review: We'll review the provided code (app.py, HTML templates) with the above information in mind. We'll pay close attention to the database interactions, statistics calculation logic, and current MQTT implementation (even though it's non-functional).

Refactoring Plan: We'll create a refactoring plan that includes:

Using SQLAlchemy as the ORM to interact with MariaDB.
Creating a statistics.py module for modular statistics calculations.
Using Paho-MQTT to publish data to EMQX.
Choosing appropriate frontend libraries (likely Chart.js and either React or Vue).
Defining the data format for MQTT messages to ensure compatibility with Home Assistant.
Implementation: We'll start implementing the refactoring plan step by step, starting with the backend changes (database access, statistics module) and then moving to the frontend and MQTT integration.
